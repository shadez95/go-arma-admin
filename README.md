# go-arma-admin

A web service for controlling and managing ARMA servers through a web API

## Status

Currently this is under heavy development and API's are subject to change without notice. I will work on a front-end in the future but getting the backend working and stable is priority.

## Contribute

If you wish to contribute, feel free to submit a PR. Please submit a PR before doing a lot of work as this project will be under constant development and don't want people to be wasting time and effort over something I may be working on already.

This project uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for dependency management.

If you want a better debugging experience, especially if you are using VS Code, it is highly recommended to install [delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve).

Tested in Go 1.10.3.

To install locally for development run `go get -u github.com/shadez95/go-arma-admin`
