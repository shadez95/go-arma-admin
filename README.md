# go-arma-admin

A RESTful web service that allows control and management of ARMA servers over the internet.

## Status

Currently this is under heavy development and API's are subject to change without notice. I will work on a front-end in the future but getting the backend working and stable is priority.

## Contribute

If you wish to contribute, feel free to submit a PR. Please submit a PR before doing a lot of work as this project will be under constant development and don't want people to be wasting time and effort over something I may be working on already.

This project requires [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) and Go 1.10.3+

To install locally run `go get -u github.com/shadez95/go-arma-admin`

That's it.
